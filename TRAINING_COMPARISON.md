## üéØ How to Test

### Option 1: Quick Test (10K samples)
```bash
# Old trainer
python scripts/train_gnn_complete.py --data sudoku.csv --max-samples 10000 --epochs 10 --batch-size 128

# New trainer
python scripts/train_production.py --data sudoku.csv --max-samples 10000 --epochs 10 --batch-size 256
```

Expected: 
- New trainer should be ~40-50% faster
- Similar or slightly better accuracy even in short run

### Option 2: Full Training

```

Expected:
- ~7-9 hours total (vs ~14 hours)
- +1-3% better final accuracy
- Early stopping may finish before 60 epochs

## üìà What to Monitor

### Training Logs to Compare

**Speed Metrics:**
- Iterations per second (it/s)

Train - Loss: 1.7234, CE: 1.5891, Constraint: 0.2686, Acc: 42.31%, Time: 135.2s, Speed: 66,420 samples/s

Val - Confidence: 0.6234, Entropy: 1.2345, Violations: 2.34
```

## üîç Analysis Points

### Is it Working?

**Good Signs:**
- ‚úÖ Higher it/s (iterations per second)
- ‚úÖ Higher samples/s
- ‚úÖ Grid accuracy increasing steadily
- ‚úÖ Solve rate > 80% by end of training
- ‚úÖ Constraint violations decreasing
- ‚úÖ Confidence increasing, entropy decreasing

**Bad Signs:**
- ‚ùå it/s slower than before (check batch size/workers)
- ‚ùå Loss not decreasing
- ‚ùå Grid accuracy plateauing early
- ‚ùå High constraint violations persist

### Troubleshooting

**If training is slower:**
1. Check GPU utilization: `nvidia-smi -l 1`
2. Reduce num_workers if CPU bottleneck
3. Increase batch_size if GPU memory allows
4. Disable persistent_workers on Windows (buggy)

**If accuracy is worse:**
1. Effective batch size might be too large (reduce accumulation)
2. Learning rate might be too high (try 0.0005)
3. Try cosine scheduler instead of onecycle
4. Check data augmentation isn't too aggressive

## üîÑ Migration Path

### Step 1: Test on Small Dataset
```bash
python scripts/train_production.py --data sudoku.csv --max-samples 10000 --epochs 5
```
Verify: No errors, reasonable speed

### Step 2: Single Full Epoch Test
```bash
python scripts/train_production.py --data sudoku.csv --epochs 1
```
Verify: Speed improvement, metrics look good

### Step 3: Full Training
```bash
python scripts/train_production.py --data sudoku.csv --epochs 60
```
Monitor: Speed, accuracy, early stopping

### Step 4: Compare Results
- Load both models
- Test on validation set
- Compare solve rates
- Choose best model

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **GPU Memory**: If OOM errors, reduce batch_size to 192 or accumulation to 1
2. **Windows**: If DataLoader hangs, set `num_workers=0`
3. **Monitoring**: Use `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi` to monitor GPU
4. **Checkpoints**: Both `policy_best.pt` and `policy_ema.pt` are saved - try both!
5. **Resume**: Can resume training from `policy.pt` checkpoint

## üìä Expected Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Cumulative |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Easy stage (15 epochs) | 1.5-2 hours | 2 hours |
| Medium stage (20 epochs) | 2-2.5 hours | 4.5 hours |
| Hard stage (25 epochs) | 2.5-3 hours | 7-7.5 hours |
| **Total** | **7-8 hours** | **(vs 14 hours before)** |

*Note: May finish earlier with early stopping*

## üéØ Next Steps After Training

1. **Evaluate Performance**
   ```bash
   python scripts/evaluate.py --model checkpoints/policy_ema.pt
   ```

2. **Test on Hard Puzzles**
   ```bash
   python scripts/solve.py --puzzle examples/hard_puzzle.sdk --model checkpoints/policy_ema.pt
   ```

3. **Compare Models**
   - Test old model vs new model
   - Compare solve rates
   - Check inference speed

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Use EMA model (`policy_ema.pt`)
   - Implement test-time augmentation if needed
   - Profile inference speed

---

## Summary

The production training should give you:
- **‚ö° 40-50% faster training** (7-9 hours vs 14 hours)
- **üìà 1-3% better accuracy** 
- **üõ°Ô∏è Better generalization** (via EMA)
- **üìä More insights** (advanced metrics)
- **üéØ Auto-stopping** (when performance plateaus)

**Total ROI: Save 5-7 hours of training time AND get better model quality!**
